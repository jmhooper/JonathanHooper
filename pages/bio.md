# Hello!

I'm Jonathan Hooper!

I'm a backend-focused software engineer with a deep expertise in Ruby and JavaScript. I've been working in software since 2011. My work has largely been focused on authentication and identity verification, where I aim to make processes smoother, more secure, and less frustrating. Currently I'm a part of the Login.gov project where I've helped scale the product from a few hundred users to over one hundred million while fostering a culture of support and collaboration within our engineering team.

I believe in the power of listening, open communication, and incremental improvement. Building trust is a key element of how I approach both problem-solving and leadership. I value the importance of challenging ideas and working together toward shared goals.

Outside of work, I’m an outdoors enthusiast—you’ll often find me biking, hiking, or backpacking with a camera in hand ready to snap photos of mushrooms.

I’m always eager to keep learning, staying humble along the way, and push beyond "good-enough" to deliver the best possible work.
