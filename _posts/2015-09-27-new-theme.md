summary:    Just rolled out a new theme for this website
---

I just did away with the old theme for my website to try out something new.
I got rid of [Pixyll](https://github.com/johnotander/pixyll) which was a good theme, 
but was a little to minimal for me.

Instead, I whipped up something new inspired by the page for [Manjaro Linux](https://manjaro.github.io/).
So far I'm really digging the retro look and feel of this one.

I was able to clean up the code from pixyll to remove features I wasn't using.
The theme was built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).
If you want to grab it and use it for your own purposes, please feel free.
The code is on [Github](https://github.com/jmhooper/jmhooper.github.io).
