# Portfolio

Here are some projects I've worked on outside of work.

## TapWater

TapWater is an iOS application built to help users track how much water they drink in a day. The app allows a user to set a goal for the number of ounces of water they wish to drink per day and track their progress as they strive to meet that goal.

This web application allows you to view animal control incidents that have occurred in East Baton Rouge Parish. Incidents can be filtered by date and by whether the incident involved a cat or a dog.

This app uses [Baton Rouge Open Data](https://data.brla.gov/) to download animal control incidents.
