I know a lot of my friends and colleagues keep blogs going to write about what they're programming that week or how they're otherwise wasting their time.
I guess I'll do the same thing.

I'll start by telling you a little bit about myself.

As of right now, I'm in my fourth year studying Computer Science at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
I grew up in a small town right outside the city and moved into the city to go school.

I enjoy programming, but I do have other hobbies.
I like spending time outdoors.
I run a good bit.
I bike to work and around BR whenever I get the chance.
Sometimes I play a little guitar, but I'm not very good.

Professionally, I'm a software engineer for a small development company here in Baton Rouge.
I do iOS and Android work along with some web programming.
The mobile work we do is native.
Most of the web stuff is in Rails but we dabble in other frameworks when they're better suited to the task.

So that's me :)
