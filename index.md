Hey, I'm Jonathan Hooper.

I'm a software engineer at [NewAperio](http://www.newaperio.com), a digital product agency located in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
My current position has me leading a team of engineers to develop our software products,
providing technical insights during the planning phase of our projects,
and working at a high level to refine our software development life cycle across all of our projects.

In addition to my role at NewAperio, I work as a digital arts instructor for [The Futures Fund](http://www.thefuturesfund.org/).
The Futures Fund is a workforce development program designed to create digital, literary, visual, and performing arts-based entrepreneurial opportunities for youth 14-18 years old.
The digital arts program aims to teach students the basics of software development.
My role includes preparing a weekly curriculum and leading a class of high school aged students.

When I'm not behind my computer or in a classroom, I enjoy spending time outdoors.
I try to take every opportunity I can to spend time camping, hiking, or riding my bicycle.
